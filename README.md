<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This app is designed to simplify and enhance users' reading experiences. It offers an intuitive platform to track books, featuring an accessible list and a progress bar to motivate users by displaying their reading progress.

Key features include:

Authentication and Authorization: Secure login and user account management.

CRUD Operations: Ability to create, update, and delete book entries within a database.

Error Handling: Robust mechanisms to manage errors and ensure smooth functionality.

The main goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of Django, keep up with the latest versions, and develop a scalable web application. Additionally, I aimed to improve my skills in integrating Python with JavaScript for a more dynamic, full-stack experience.
