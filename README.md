<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A full stack reading tracker app inspired by Goodreads. This project is designed to simplify users' reading experience. It provides an easy and efficient way to keep track of the user's books in an accessible list, while the progress bar to track their reading progress helps users feel more motivated to finish the books.

This app handles authentication, authorization, error handling and creating, deleting and updating objects in a database (CRUD).

Machine learning book recommendation section in progress.

The goal with this project was to challenge my knowledge of Django by keeping up with newer versions, and to create a large-scale web app that is easily scalable.
Another goal was to develop skills in combining Python with JavaScript.
